# ToDo-list-App

## Description
Welcome to my django project! This is a Todo list app made in Python and the Django framework. It allows users to quickly and easily add, delete, and update lists and tasks. With this app, users can effortlessly manage their tasks and lists, helping them stay 
organized and on top of their to-do list. I hope you enjoy and look forward to your contributions!
